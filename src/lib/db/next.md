## todo

- [x] test cases for broken things
- [ ] measure performance (esp. vs redux-persist)
- [ ] handle atomic transactions
- [ ] handle conflicts
- [ ] \(way later) handle schemas
- [ ] fix react integration (stop duplicating state, remove hacks, etc.)

minor:
- [ ] debounce storage events
- [ ] possibly use a broadcastchannel to sync changes cross tabs?
