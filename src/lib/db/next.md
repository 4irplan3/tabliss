## todo

- [x] test cases for broken things
- [x] prefix iteration function
- [x] add indexeddb storage
- [ ] measure performance (esp. vs redux-persist)
- [o] handle atomic transactions
- [x] wait for storage to populate db
- [ ] handle conflicts
- [ ] \(way later) handle schemas
- [o] fix react integration (~stop duplicating state~, remove hacks, etc.)

minor:

- [ ] debounce storage events
- [ ] possibly use a broadcastchannel to sync changes cross tabs?
